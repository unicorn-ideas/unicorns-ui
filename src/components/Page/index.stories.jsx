    <h1>Spasm of Excitement!</h1>
    <p>
      He felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who it was, or
      at least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once you know what it is
      you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to
      know that it is. There. All done. No more nastiness. One of the
      troublesome circumstances was the Plural nature of this Galactic Sector,
      where the possible continually interfered with the probable. The ship had

      drawbacks. Life was so pleasant and relaxed these days, there was time to
      let things sink in.

      Something to do with an interplanetary incident involving an umbrella with
      mythical powers and the secret formula for a prize-winning ice cream.
      Funny old thing, life, isn’t it? Dreams come true all the time, just not
      for the dreamers. “Look,” he said again, “imagine this napkin, right, as
      the temporal Universe. right? And this spoon as a transductional mode in
      the matter curve…” Her mood swings were very unpredictable but so far
      they’d all been between different types of bad ones.
